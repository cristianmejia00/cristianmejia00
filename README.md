### Hi there, I'm Cristian 👋

**Associate Professor @ U-Tokyo | Computational Social Scientist | Full-Stack Developer**

I operate at the intersection of **Innovation Management** and **Data Science**. My work involves building computational tools to map technology landscapes, measure economic complexity, and forecast the socio-economic impacts of AGI.

I use code to turn qualitative policy questions into quantitative network problems.

#### 🛠️ The Toolbox

I balance between rapid prototyping for startups and rigorous data analysis for academia.

* **Data & ML:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, BERTopic), R, SQL.
* **Web & Viz:** JavaScript, **Vue.js** (for reactive interfaces), **Sigma.js** (for large-scale network visualization).
* **Infrastructure:** AWS (EC2, S3), Docker.
* **Methods:** Large Language Models (LLMs) for text mining, Bibliometrics, Multi-regional Input-Output Analysis.

#### 🔭 Current Dev Projects

I am currently building tools to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world application:

* **Paper-Digest:** (Co-founder) An application using extractive AI summarization to make academic literature accessible.
* **Social Attention Indicators:** A text-mining pipeline to measure the lag between technological breakthroughs and public/policy awareness (JSPS Grant Project).
* **SCT Visualization Tool:** A custom Vue.js + Sigma.js application to visualize collaboration networks and knowledge spillovers between universities.
* **Climate-Tech Database:** Developing a structured database to track innovation in sustainable technologies.

#### 🔬 Research Focus (The "Why" behind the Code)

My repositories often support research into:

* **Post-AGI Economics:** Investigating "Universal Basic Compute" and new economic metrics for the post-labor transition.
* **Global Systems:** Estimating Scope 3 emissions through global shareholder networks of publicly traded firms.
* **Tech Mining:** Using LLMs to filter technology-social issue links in literature-based discovery.
* **Science Policy:** Analyzing the alignment (or lack thereof) between AI regulation (like the EU AI Act) and academic research.

#### 📚 Continuous Learning

I believe in staying technically sharp. Recent certifications include:
* **CAIDP AI Policy Clinic** (Distinction) - *Center for AI and Digital Policy*
* **Applied AI Specialization** - *IBM*
* **Startup School** - *Y Combinator*
